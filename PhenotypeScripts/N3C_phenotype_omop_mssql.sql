/**
Change log:
Version 1 - initial commit
Version 2 - updated possible positive cases (typo in name of concept set name) and added additional NIH VSAC codeset_id
NOTE: as of V2, OMOP vocabularies have released an update to include new LOINC codes but the load of these concept_ids into atlas-covid19 has not been completed, when this is done we will include these into the concept_set generated
Version 3 - consolidated to single cohort definition and added N3C COHORT table + labeling statements
Version 4 - reconfiguration using SQLRender
Version 5 - updating LOINC concept sets, subset of Weak Positive and Strong Positive concept sets into before and after April 1 and new logic to include this distinction

Instructions:
Cohorts were assembled using OHDSI Atlas (atlas-covid19.ohdsi.org)
This MS SQL script is the artifact of this ATLAS cohort definition: http://atlas-covid19.ohdsi.org/#/cohortdefinition/1015
If desired to evaluate feasibility of each cohort, individual cohorts are available:
1- Lab-confirmed positive cases (http://atlas-covid19.ohdsi.org/#/cohortdefinition/655)
2- Lab-confirmed negative cases (http://atlas-covid19.ohdsi.org/#/cohortdefinition/656)
3- Suspected positive cases	(http://atlas-covid19.ohdsi.org/#/cohortdefinition/657)
4- Possible positive cases (http://atlas-covid19.ohdsi.org/#/cohortdefinition/658)

To run, you will need to find and replace @cdmDatabaseSchema, @vocabularyDatabaseSchema with your local OMOP schema details
Harmonization note:
In OHDSI conventions, we do not usually write tables to the main database schema.
NOTE: OHDSI uses @resultsDatabaseSchema as a results schema build cohort tables for specific analysis. We built the N3C_COHORT table in this results schema as we know many OMOP analyst do not have write access to their @cdmDatabaseSchema.


Begin building cohort following OHDSI standard cohort definition process
