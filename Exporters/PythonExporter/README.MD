**Python Data Exporter**

You can (optionally) use our Python Data Exporter to run the N3C data extract scripts in sequence, basically hands-free. You can schedule this to run as a cron job if you’d like to use it to dump your data on a recurring basis.

**System Prerequisites**



*   Python 3.x
*   Oracle or MS SqlServer
*   To use the sftp feature, you may need to install paramiko:  python -m pip install paramiko
*   You should have already copied one of the [extract SQL files](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/Phenotype_Data_Acquisition/tree/master/ExtractScripts) and [phenotype SQL file](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/Phenotype_Data_Acquisition/tree/master/PhenotypeScripts) to a local directory.

**Running the Exporter**



1. Copy or download the contents of this folder to your local system. To make it easy, use the same directory where your extract SQL and phenotype SQL files are located.
2. You may need to edit the extract SQL and phenotype SQL for the queries to work on your local system. 
3. Use the "config_example.ini" file to create your own configuration.  You will want to edit your config file and enter in information for database connection, sftp connection and zip file create (site).
4. Run the following command, replacing the arguments with whatever options make sense for your environment. 


```
python db_exp.py --config config.ini --database oracle --phenotype N3C_phenotype_V1_0_act_oracle.sql --sql N3C_extract_V1_0_act_oracle.sql --output_dir E:\N3C --zip --sftp
```

**Script Command Line Options**


*   --help
*   --config (config file name)  See file "config_example.ini"
*   --phenotype (phenotype SQL file name)
*   --sql (extract SQL file name)
*   --database (oracle or mssql)
*   --output_dir (output directory for export)   Output directory must have a sub-directory "datafiles".
*   --zip
*   --sftp

**What will my output look like?**

Once you run the exporter, your files will be output in the following directory structure:

**_Parent Directory_**

**_Sub-Directory_**

(These are OMOP files--if you use PCORnet or ACT, your exported tables will have different names/quantity, but will be in the same directly structure.) Note that these files are .csv files, but are actually pipe delimited rather than comma delimited. The exporter will take care of delimiters, formatting, headers, and everything else you need to be compliant with our formatting.

**Bug Reports/Enhancement Requests/Contributions**

We would love to hear from you about this script, as we hope to continue to improve and enhance it. We also welcome contributions, if there’s a cool feature you’ve added locally. Please feel free to open an issue or create a pull request as needed!
