***	BEFORE USE, COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING STEPS:																		***
*** 	1. Modify covid_lab table WHERE expression to include your applicable lab test raw names					***
***				a.  FIND: lab_result_cm.raw_lab_name																***
*** 	2. Use Find+Replace to update the source and destination database/schemas. 									***
***			FIND: @cdmDatabaseSchema			==> REPLACE: SOURCE_SCHEMA.DATABASE 		(e.g., PCORNET.dbo)		***
***			FIND: @resultsDatabaseSchema		==> REPLACE: DESTINATION_SCHEMA.DATABASE 	(e.g., PCORNET.n3c)		***
***				a.  If your source/destination database schemas are the same, replace with the same 				***
***					value both times (e.g., PCORNET.dbo)															***
